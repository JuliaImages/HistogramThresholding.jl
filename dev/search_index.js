Suppose that f has support on some interval I = ab.  Let m be an integer and a = a_1  a_2  ldots  a_m  a_m+1 = b a sequence of real numbers. Construct a sequence of intervals\n\nI_1 = a_1a_2 I_2 = (a_2 a_3 ldots I_m = (a_ma_m+1\n\nwhich partition I into subsets I_j (j = 1 ldots m) on which f is constant. These subsets satisfy I_i cap I_j = emptyset forall i neq j, and are commonly referred to as bins. Together they encompass the entire range of data values such that sum_j I_j  =  I . Each bin has width w_j = I_j = a_j+1 - a_j and height h_j which is the constant probability density over the region of the bin. Integrating the constant probability density over the width of the bin w_j yields a probability mass of pi_j = h_j w_j for the bin.\n\nFor a sample x_1 x_2 ldots x_N, let\n\nn_j = sum_n = 1^Nmathbf1_(I_j)(x_n)\nquad textwhere quad\nmathbf1_(I_j)(x) =\nbegincases\n 1  textif  x in I_j\n 0  textotherwise\nendcases\n\nrepresent the number of samples falling into the interval I_j. An estimate for the probability mass of the jth bin is given by the relative frequency hatpi = fracn_jN, and the histogram estimator of the probability density function is defined as\n\nbeginaligned\nhatf_n(x)   = sum_j = 1^mfracn_jNw_j mathbf1_(I_j)(x) \n = sum_j = 1^mfrachatpi_jw_j mathbf1_(I_j)(x) \n = sum_j = 1^mhath_j mathbf1_(I_j)(x)\nendaligned\n\nThe function hatf_n(x) is a genuine density estimator because hatf_n(x)  ge 0 and\n\nbeginaligned\nint_-infty^inftyhatf_n(x) operatornamedx  = sum_j=1^m fracn_jNw_j w_j \n = 1\nendaligned\n\nOptions\n\nVarious options for the parameters of this function are described in more detail below.\n\nChoices for nbins\n\nYou can specify the number of discrete bins for the histogram. When specifying the number of bins consider the maximum number of graylevels that your image type supports. For example, with an image of type N0f8 there is a maximum of 256 possible graylevels. Hence, if you request more than 256 bins for that type of image you should expect to obtain zero counts for numerous bins.\n\nChoices for minval\n\nYou have the option to specify the lower bound of the interval over which the histogram will be computed.  If minval is not specified then the minimum value present in the image is taken as the lower bound.\n\nChoices for maxval\n\nYou have the option to specify the upper bound of the interval over which the histogram will be computed.  If maxval is not specified then the maximum value present in the image is taken as the upper bound.\n\nChoices for edges\n\nIf you do not designate the number of bins, nor the lower or upper bound of the interval, then you have the option to directly stipulate how the intervals will be divided by specifying a AbstractRange type.\n\nExample\n\nCompute the histogram of a grayscale image.\n\n\nusing TestImages, FileIO, ImageView\n\nimg =  testimage(\"mandril_gray\");\nedges, counts  = build_histogram(img, 256, minval = 0, maxval = 1)\n\nGiven a color image, compute the histogram of the red channel.\n\nimg = testimage(\"mandrill\")\nr = red.(img)\nedges, counts  = build_histogram(r, 256, minval = 0, maxval = 1)\n\nReferences\n\n[1] E.
