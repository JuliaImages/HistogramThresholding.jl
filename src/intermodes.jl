"""
```
t = find_threshold(Intermodes(), histogram, edges; maxiter = 8000)
```

Under the assumption that the histogram is bimodal the histogram is smoothed
using a length-3 mean filter until two modes remain. The threshold is then set
to the average value of the two modes.

# Output

Returns a real number `t` in `edges`. The `edges` parameter represents an
`AbstractRange` which specifies the intervals associated with the histogram bins.

# Details

If after `maxiter` iterations the smoothed histogram is still not bimodal then
the algorithm will fall back to using the `UnimodalRosin` method to select
a threshold.

# Arguments

The function arguments are described in more detail below.

##  `histogram`

An `AbstractArray` storing the frequency distribution.

##  `edges`

An `AbstractRange` specifying how the intervals for the frequency distribution
are divided.

## `maxiter`

An `Int` that specifies the maximum number of smoothing iterations. If left
unspecified a default value of 8000 is used.

# Example

Compute the threshold for the "cameraman" image in the `TestImages` package.

```julia

using TestImages, ImageContrastAdjustment, HistogramThresholding

img = testimage("cameraman")
edges, counts = build_histogram(img,256)
#=
  The `counts` array stores at index 0 the frequencies that were below the
  first bin edge. Since we are seeking a threshold over the interval
  partitioned by `edges` we need to discard the first bin in `counts`
  so that the dimensions of `edges` and `counts` match.
=#
t = find_threshold(Intermodes(), counts[1:end], edges)
```
